# Current Projects

I joined the department full time in late November (2019)! Currently I am interested in learning more about computationally eficient algorithms for detecting and locating changes in dynamic networks with multi-layer structures, examples of which include the evolution of international trade patterns over time. 

# Previous Research

My MSc thesis looked at screening methods for ultra-wide panels of stationary time series, and extended the [tilting](https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1467-9868.2011.01023.x) method for variable selection to the time series setting; you can find a copy of the thesis [here](Dissertation.pdf). Before graduate school I was a resech scholar at the [Cross-disciplinary Centre for Systems Analysis](https://www.york.ac.uk/yccsa/) housed in the University of York, where I looked at using flexible parametric distributions to model clinical risk.
