# Hello!

Welcome to Shakeel's academic webpage! I am a first year MPhil/PhD student in Statistics at the London School of Economics and Political Science; I am part of the [Time Series and Statistical Learning](http://www.lse.ac.uk/Statistics/Research/Time-Series) research group, and my supervisor is Professor [Piotr Fryzlewicz](http://stats.lse.ac.uk/fryzlewicz/). Some of my research interests include: 


* High dimensional time series analysis
* Causal inference in data rich environments
* Algorithms for dynamic network analysis
* Clever uses of trees and forests
